ProProject Studio (**PPS**) is a project management tool created for recording engineers, mixing engineers, mastering engineers, and their respective clients. **PPS** focuses
on three main asspects of the recording or mixing process. These steps are **Pre-production, Tracking, and Mixing.**

## Pre-production
This is the process of gathering information from the client, band, or artist before stepping into the studio. **PPS** enables engineers to consolidate this information in one place and reducing the amount of time spent away from the control room. **PPS** utilizes Spotify's API to allow clients to attach references to each cell of the **Project Editor** to encourage clear and consistent communication between the engineer and the client.

## Tracking
The **Project Editor** should be a familiar interface for those in the buisness of making records. The added functionality of **PPS** takes this tried and true format and enhances it for the modern age. The added functionality of attaching notes, song information, and references are just the tip of the iceberg for the future possibilites of this application.

## Mixing
Mix revisions are something every engineer has to deal with, and their is no technology availible that beats the artist in the room pointing out the trouble spots. **PPS** aims to correct this by incorperating ideas from the hugely popular platform of **Soundcloud**. Allowing the client to make timestamped notes on the player itself allows for quicker revisions for the engineer and quicker releases for the client.

## Looking Ahead
The potential for **PPS** is huge. Their is currently nocompetitor in the recording project mangement space, and the pro audio market is huge. 

## Technology
**PPS** uses the following technology:
* MongoDB
* Express
* React
* Redux
* Node JS
* Webpack

This repo is the front end of **PPS**. The backend can be found [here.](https://github.com/hegner123/pps-back)
